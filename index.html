                <p>Our country’s healthcare and emergency services system is something that needs
                    improving. Whenever someone has to go to the hospital they have to fill out multiple
                    sheets of information, and then wait hours to even see a doctor. This not only puts
                    people’s health at risk, but it also creates agitation in the emergency room which is the
                    last place it’s needed. Our plan is to create an app to allow people to check in and fill
                    out all necessary paperwork, so that once they arrive at the hospital they can go straight
                    to the back and/or reduce their waiting time significantly.

                    My group brainstormed about the different users that would be using our app, the problems that we are fixing,
                     what the app will do, and problems that could happen because of the app.
