                    <p>Our country’s healthcare and emergency services system is something that needs
                        improving. Whenever someone has to go to the hospital they have to fill out multiple
                        sheets of information, and then wait hours to even see a doctor. This not only puts
                        people’s health at risk, but it also creates agitation in the emergency room which is the
                        last place it’s needed. Our plan is to create an app to allow people to check in and fill
                        out all necessary paperwork, so that once they arrive at the hospital they can go straight
                        to the back and/or reduce their waiting time significantly.
